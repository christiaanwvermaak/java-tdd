Requirement:
    Truncate title, 1st paragraph or another string with "..."
    if over character limit (width must be flexible)

Think:
------------
Inputs?:
    - String to truncate or not
    - Length at which to start truncating

Tests:
------------
    - Exceeds character limit -> string is truncated with "..."
    - Less than limit -> string is unchanged

More Tests:
------------
    - Invalid String (null)
    - Empty string (nothing in the string - zero length)
    - Blank string (just whitespace)
    - Invalid limit (0 or less)

More complex tests (combinatronics):
----------------------------------------

    What if?
        - input < ellipses
        - input == ellipses
